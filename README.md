This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using typescript as template.

## Install dependencies

Run `yarn install`

### To run the app

Run `yarn start` to start the app in the development mode.
It will automatically spin up on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, if asked to use another port because 3000 for some reason is already in use, chose yes.

### Building to production

Run `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

If you do have serve installed globally you also serve the build version as a local static page, for more check out: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve
